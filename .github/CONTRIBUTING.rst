Before you start
----------------

All new code and documentation changes to Tahoe-LAFS goes through a
review process.  We like to help, and we would like you to be aware of
a few things before you start.

  * Communicate early and often.  Before you pick an area to work on,
    please discuss your intention in our IRC channel or in the mailing
    list.  Ask questions and seek feedback early and often.  That way,
    we will be more prepared to help you if you are stuck.

  * Begin small.  Smaller sets of changes get reviewed fairly quickly.
    If you produce a large set of changes with little prior
    communication, we will struggle to review your changes.  That will
    result in frustration for all of us.  We would like to help you
    stay motivated.

Tahoe-LAFS project has been around and growing for over fifteen years
now.  As a result of the project's age, some of our practices pre-date
what is fashionable at the time of writing.  It is very likely that
you will make new and surprising findings, and it is quite likely that
your findings might surprise current active contributors as well.
